We never had the opportunity to debate and discuss the matter until today.  It was tabled as an amendment to the Bill as passed by the Seanad by the Minister in the Dil.  The debate in the Dil was guillotined, so there was no debate on this matter in the Dil.  As we are rushing the Bill and the Minister is choosing to rush legislation in this fashion, we have a situation today where we had a lengthy debate on the matter and identified alternative approaches which would make for better legislation, but because of the rush the Minister is not inclined to entertain the amendments tabled today.  The blasphemy aspect of the Bill is a backwards step in legislation on the issue of defamation.","23","22"

As the Dil has gone on summer recess the Minister was set against taking any amendments but there has been some clarification of the legislation.  Fine Gael supports this Bill because there is a major problem of gangland crime and criminality.  Many innocent people have been killed and many communities have been disrupted and intimidated.  If this legislation goes some way to addressing that problem, our work will have been justified.","37"," 5"
